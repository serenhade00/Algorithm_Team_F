I faced my biggest obstacle back when I was about to graduate the elementary school in Korea. Out of nowhere, one day I heard that we may have to migrate to another country. This was due to my father who was assigned a new position in Vietnam international airport. Since he was expected to be away for 3 years, rest of our family had no choice but to move together. After moving to Vietnam, I was informed that I will be attending an international school. This was my huge problem at that time because I didn't know how to speak fluent English nor did I have any friends there. I think it took one whole semester to get used to the new environment and the school curriculum. I overcame the obstacle by starting a conversation with a lot of people, that way I could practice my speaking skills as well as my listening skills. When I was listening to another person I tried to pay close attention so that I become more familiar with new vocabulary and expressions. After gaining some confidence I began to enjoy the life that I was having there. Looking back, it is definitely one of my great experience and a unforgettable obstacle at the same time.

After gaining some confidence I began to enjoy the life that I was having there. Looking back, it is definitely one of my great experience and a unforgettable obstacle at the same time. I faced my biggest obstacle back when I was about to graduate the elementary school in Korea. Out of nowhere, one day I heard that we may have to migrate to another country. This was due to my father who was assigned a new position in Vietnam international airport. Since he was expected to be away for 3 years, rest of our family had no choice but to move together. After moving to Vietnam, I was informed that I will be attending an international school. This was my huge problem at that time because I didn't know how to speak fluent English nor did I have any friends there. I think it took one whole semester to get used to the new environment and the school curriculum. I overcame the obstacle by starting a conversation with a lot of people, that way I could practice my speaking skills as well as my listening skills. When I was listening to another person I tried to pay close attention so that I become more familiar with new vocabulary and expressions.
